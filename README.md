# Build a Fullstack + Serverless Web Application using AWS Amplify 

Welcome! This is a beginner workshop targetted at University students (studying IT / Computer Science) who are new to Amazon Web Services. The main question we seek to answer by the end of this workshop is: 

`How can I use AWS to enhance my own personal projects?`

To answer this question, we will focus on using AWS to supercharge **web development**, specifically by:
1. Explaining the **benefits** of using AWS to build web applications.
2. Providing a high-level overview of key AWS services, including Lambda, S3, Cognito, API gateway, etc. 
3. Using AWS Amplify to seamlessly connect a range of AWS services to produce a fullstack, serverless web application.

## Workshop Theory
As a University student, you may have had some experience creating small, mini applications as part of your assessments - for example, random websites, algorithmic chunks of code, or just random python scripts. But you may be wondering, how are industrial, fully-fledged applications, such as Facebook, Google or even Github, actually built? 

The architecture of such applications is fairly complicated, and consist of so many different components responsible for different tasks.
